		<h2>INVENTION OF FIXED TELEPHONY</h2>
     <img id="image2" src="http://www.elon.edu/images/e-web/predictions/1892bell.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>
		
			<p>In the 1870s, the telegraphic specialist, <strong>Elisha Gray</strong>, conducted research to transmit simultaneously several messages on the same line of the telegraph (invented in 1837), using alternating and non-continuous current, research that would lead to the invention the phone. At the same time, American-born speech-language pathologist Graham Bell did almost identical work and was the first to patent the invention of the voice transmission system. 
			Thus, on March 10, 1876, Graham Bell succeeded in the first transmission on electric wires of a voice message, to a room on another floor, where his assistant <strong>Thomas Watson</strong> was standing, a phrase still famous: "Mr. Watson, come here, I need you! ".<br/></p>
			
			<p>However, <strong>Elisah Gray</strong> has developed much of the technical elements that will be used later on the phone. Thus a legal battle over the paternity of the invention then took place between Bell and Gray, taking into account the industrial and economic stakes. The court will finally agree with <strong> <a href="#bell">Alexander Graham Bell</strong></a> that history will also hold, even if this quarrel should rebound in the 1887 when Antonio Meucci, an immigrant of Italian origin, filed a lawsuit to obtain the cancellation of the patent granted to Bell in reason, among others, that he had made a provisional patent application in 1871 (the latter, lack of means to renew it, expired in 1874). <br></p>
			
			<p>The trial continued after the death of Meucci (which occurred in 1889) until 1897. But the official history (outside Italy) ignored the name of the Italian-American Antonio Meucci for more than a century until his death. that the US House of Representatives finally recognizes Meucci's anteriority and contribution to the invention of the telephone. It was June 11, 2002 <br>

		<h2>TECHNOLOGIES OF FIXED TELEPHONY</h2>
		<p>The traditional wired telephony uses several techniques, the first is the modulation at low frequencies (vocal frequencies) of a carrier current on a two-wire line. The second, the power supply by a central battery and the third is that of the switched lines.</p>
		
		<h4 class="main">Analog telephony</h4>
		<p>The telephony was originally intended to transmit the human voice between two places distant from each other. It uses as support electrical lines on which a current analogous to the sound signals passes.

A basic telephone link consists of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Two transceiver devices called telephone sets</li>
				<li>A two-wire line carrying the signals (twisted pair)</li>
				<li>A source of electrical energy. The DC voltage required to power the telephone sets is provided by a source installed in the central office (central battery).</li>
			</ul>

		<h4 class="main">Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)</h4>
		<p>Each customer is assigned a personal number. Telephone equipment is designed to connect all subscribers (telecommunication):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Either by borrowing the lines of the public network RTC, these are external communications.</li>
				<li>In the same company, this is internal communications handled by a private branch exchange.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Access to the public network is then done by dialing an additional prefix.

The switches constitute the various points or nodes of the Switched Telephone Network or PSTN and are connected by transmission arrays of different types: coaxial cables, fiber optic cables, radio links, satellites.
</p>
		<h4 class="main">Voice over IP, also usable in mobile telephony</h4>
		<p>VoIP, or VoIP for Voice over IP, is a technique for communicating via voice (or via multimedia streams: audio or video) over IP-enabled networks, whether private networks or Internet, wired (cable / ADSL / optical) or not (satellite, Wi-Fi, GSM, UMTS or LTE).
VoIP is about voice transport over an IP network.

		<h2>TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THE FIXED PHONE</h2>
		
		<h3><a class="evolution"><strong><a name ="bell">1876: Alexander Graham Bell</strong> </a>invents the phone</h3>
		<p>The operating principle of the phone:
A metal plate attached to a membrane is activated by the voice and vibrates in front of an electromagnet. These vibrations make it possible to produce a variable electric current. Thanks to an electric cable, the electric current can be transported and the speech becomes transmissible.

At the other end of the cable, at the receiver, a device identical to the first can reproduce the voice.
</p>
		<h3 class="evolution">1880: The Ader phone</h3>
		<img class = "image1" src="http://collectionhistorique.orange.com/var/usine/storage/images/media/collectionhistorique-media/objets/cht00667_235/210948-1-fre-FR/CHT00667_235.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>
		<p>In 1880, Ader, a French engineer, perfected the Bell system. This phone consisted of three distinct elements:
</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a microphone for talking, located behind a pine board fixed on the base,</li>
				<li>and two earphones placed on the sides to hear the interlocutor.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>This phone was only a small part of the installation needed to communicate. Two batteries consisting of a glass bottle filled with electrolyte and electrodes had to be connected to operate the device.</p>
		
		<h3 class="evolution">1892: The Mildé phone</h3>
		<img class = "image1" src="http://collectionhistorique.orange.com/var/usine/storage/images/media/collectionhistorique-media/objets/cht00008_235/211378-1-fre-FR/CHT00008_235.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>	
			<p>Manual :
				<ul>
					<li>Press the call button 3 or 4 times and wait for the ringing tone.</li>
					<li>Unhook the two receivers, apply them on the ears to hear the operator.</li>
					<li>Tell the operator the name and address of her correspondent and wait for her to establish communication, then talk very close to the device.</li>
				
				</ul>
			Before the invention of the handset, the microphone is secured to the housing. It is located behind a pine board whose role is to capture the
sound vibrations of the voice. These are then transmitted to a small capsule glued to the center containing the coal shot. The two earphones placed on the side allowed to isolate themselves completely from outside noises. This last precaution was indispensable: the level of speech received was very low.
			</p>
				
		<h3 class="evolution">1910: The Marty</h3>
		<img class = "image1" src="http://collectionhistorique.orange.com/var/usine/storage/images/media/collectionhistorique-media/objets/cht01857_235/208858-1-fre-FR/CHT01857_235.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>
			<p>Manual :
				<ul>
					<li>Operate the crank on the side to call the operator.</li>
					<li>Pick up the handset, consisting of a receiver to listen and a microphone to talk.</li>
				</ul>
			The Marty phone is a wooden box. This device is the first device in the state network incorporating a magnetic call (a magneto), to contact the operator without the need for a battery. They are also the first phones to meet specific specifications, and are thus produced in large series by several companies. The model manufactured by the Association of
Workers in Precision Instruments (AOIP) is by far the most common.
			</p>
			
        <h3 class="evolution">1920: The horn phone</h3>
			<p>
			In the twenties, fashion inspired manufacturers with handsets
"Hygienic". Traditional handsets are blamed for being a vector of contagion of diseases. Thus, the horn shape allows the user to clean the conduit of the microphone with a simple cloth.

These handsets are called monophone or diaphone according to the manufacturers. The microphone and the earphone are installed in the upper part, the horn playing the role of acoustic conduit.
			</p>
			
        <h3 class="evolution">1922: The mobile PTT24</h3>
<img class = "image1" src="http://collectionhistorique.orange.com/var/usine/storage/images/media/collectionhistorique-media/objets/cht03057_235/209767-1-fre-FR/CHT03057_235.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>
			<p>In the 1920s, the dialing telephone with 10 digits (from 0 to 9) appeared to dial a correspondent's number. 
In 1922, the administration launches a competition to establish a unique model on its network. The PTT24 is chosen in 1924, hence its name.
It is a device planned from the beginning for the automatic networks. However, there is a local battery version for private networks (it does not mention the property status). Its electrical characteristics are excellent (the microphone is very sensitive) and it is robust.
			</p>
			
		<h3 class="evolution">1943: The U43</h3>
		<img class = "image1" src="http://collectionhistorique.orange.com/var/usine/storage/images/media/collectionhistorique-media/objets/cht03152_235/211500-1-fre-FR/CHT03152_235.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>	
			<p>Manual :
				<ul>
					<li>Operation to discover with the dial model available in the room.</li>
				</ul>
			This universal post 1943 (U43), manufactured in Bakelite (very hard plastic), contributed to the democratization of the telephone in France. His specifications were ambitious:
				<ul>
					<li>be universal, to be compatible with the most common types of networks (automatic or manual networks with central battery),</li>
					<li>have a low manufacturing cost in order to meet a high demand,</li>
					<li>and be designed with materials available because of the shortage of metals in times of war.</li>
				</ul>
				The U43 was officially selected in 1943 following a competition launched by the administration and won by Ericsson. In the very first versions, the dial is that of the PTT24.
			</p>
			
		<h3 class="evolution">1963: The S63</h3>
		<img class = "image1" src="http://collectionhistorique.orange.com/var/usine/storage/images/media/collectionhistorique-media/objets/cht02060_235/210672-1-fre-FR/CHT02060_235.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>	
				<p>Manual :
					<ul>
						<li>Operation to discover with the dial model available in the room.</li>
					</ul>
				The most widely manufactured station remains the S63. It takes its name from the abbreviation SO. CO. SUCH (Company Telephone Builders) and its date of design, 1963. It is a modern manufacturing station: chassis and shell injected plastic, circuit board receiving all electronic components, built-in buzzer with adjustable volume. The first version is made in gray color. It is subsequently declined in blue, brown, red and white.
				</p>
			
		<h3 class="evolution">1975: The T75</h3>
		<img class = "image1" src="https://www.galerie-doda.fr/8824-full/telephone-telic-t75-orange.jpg" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>		
			<p>Manual :
				<ul>
					<li>Operation to discover with the model keys available in the room.</li>
				</ul>
			The post Télic 1975, or T75, is the first telephone "electronic" French. It is designed and manufactured in Strasbourg, in one of the units that will later become Alcatel. Its innovations are a design particularly close to the trends of its time (rounded shapes, orange color), electronic keyboard numbering, and the ability to listen amplified through the speaker that emits the ring. Note that the amplified listening function requires the installation of batteries inside the station.

		<h3 class="evolution">1983: DynaTAC 8000X</h3>
    <img class = "image1" src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2018/02/23/TELEMMGLPICT000155265540_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGnvE-VNXSbhg1qqFSd7ePxzwyuiv_lBAipawb18o-HA.jpeg?imwidth=1400" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>
			<p>
			The very first mobile phone was designed and manufactured by Professor Martin Cooper, who was then in 1973 Director of the Research and Development at Motorola. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			His camera is only a prototype, and his name is Dynatac. The first mobile for sale in the United States will appear only ten years later under the name of DynaTAC 8000x. However this phone is reserved for people fairly well-off: it costs not less than $ 3,995 to get it. In addition, it is very imposing: 25 centimeters antenna not included for 783g. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Another defect, its autonomy is very small ... Indeed, we can enjoy it for an hour only! If its huge proportions amaze you, know that it is the smallest mobile phone created for the time.
			</p>
		<h3 class="evolution">2002: Siemens Gigaset A340</h3>
    <img class = "image1" src="https://pic.clubic.com/v1/images/879933/raw?width=436&height=327&fit=max&hash=f8b28022257eb6e94e11aec0993968da57b4835f" alt "pic from flickr" width =300>
			<p>
			Wireless phones have a limited range (100 to 300 m maximum), which allows movement in a home or business. It consists of a base, connected to the telephone network, containing a radio transmitter and receiver and a speaker for ringing, and a handset with a microphone and a speaker for conversation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Since the early 1990s, these phones use the DECT standard (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephone - Enhanced Digital Cordless Telephone). It is a digital wireless telephony standard for both individuals and businesses over the frequency range 1,880 to 1,900 MHz. This standard, although designed for a wide range of uses, is today mainly used for voice communications.
